# XMM-Newton X-ray Source Analysis

A data science analysis of the **4XMM-DR14** X-ray source catalog from the XMM-Newton space observatory, featuring original dimensionality reduction technique and astronomical data preprocessing.

## üåå Overview

This repository contains a complete analysis pipeline for exploring X-ray source data from the **XMM-Newton** space telescope's **4th XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source Catalog (4XMM-DR14)**. The project demonstrates the application of data science methodologies to astronomical datasets, with particular emphasis on discovering hidden patterns in X-ray source properties.

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing**: Quality filtering, outlier removal, and feature engineering
- **Innovative PCA¬≤ Analysis**: Double Principal Component Analysis
- **Astronomical Data Handling**: Proper treatment of X-ray flux measurements, hardness ratios, and temporal data
- **Pattern Discovery**: Identification of distinct source populations and unusual objects

## üìä Dataset

**Source**: ESA's XMM-Newton Science Archive  
**Catalog**: 4XMM-DR14 (4th XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source Catalog, Data Release 14)  
**Format**: Slim version containing key measurements for unique X-ray sources  
**Size**: ~540,000 X-ray sources (after preprocessing: ~280,000 high-quality sources)

**Note**: The public catalogue is usually screened to remove high-background/solar-flare intervals and also mixes MOS & pn cameras.

### Key Measurements

- **Multi-band X-ray fluxes** (0.2-12.0 keV in various energy bands)
- **Hardness ratios** (spectral hardness indicators HR1-HR4)  
- **Variability parameters** (temporal variability measurements)
- **Source properties** (spatial extent, detection quality, coordinates)
- **Temporal information** (observation dates, detection counts)

### Dependencies

- **pandas** (‚â•1.3.0): Data manipulation and analysis
- **polar** (‚â•1.32.0): Data manipulation and analysis
- **matplotlib** (‚â•3.5.0): Visualization and plotting  
- **scikit-learn** (‚â•0.24.0): Machine learning and PCA
- **astropy** (‚â•5.0.0): Astronomical data handling and time conversions

## üìà Analysis Pipeline

### 1. Data Preprocessing (`preprocessing.ipynb`)

**Objective**: Transform raw catalog data into a clean, analysis-ready dataset.

**Key Steps**:
- ‚úÖ **Quality Filtering**: Remove sources with poor detection flags (`sc_sum_flag ‚â† 0`)
- ‚úÖ **Missing Data Handling**: Strategic approach to NaN values (removal vs. imputation)
- ‚úÖ **Hardness Ratio Quality Control**: Ensure complete spectral information
- ‚úÖ **Outlier Removal**: Modified IQR method for error measurements (98th percentile filtering)
- ‚úÖ **Feature Engineering**: Convert MJD timestamps to datetime format
- ‚úÖ **Data Optimization**: Remove uninformative columns and optimize data types

**Outcome**: High-quality dataset with ~280,000 sources containing complete measurements.

### 2. (Simple) Exploratory Data Analysis (`EDA.ipynb`)

**Objective**: Understand data distributions, correlations, and basic patterns.

**Analysis Components**:
- Distribution analysis of X-ray fluxes and hardness ratios
- Correlation analysis between spectral measurements
- Temporal distribution of observations
- Spatial distribution across the sky
- Variability analysis

### 3. Advanced Pattern Discovery (`PCA^2.ipynb`)

**Objective**: Apply innovative PCA¬≤ technique to uncover hidden structure in X-ray source data.

#### **The PCA¬≤ Innovation**

**PCA¬≤** (PCA-Squared) is a novel two-stage dimensionality reduction technique:

1. **Stage 1**: Standard PCA on original features ‚Üí captures main population trends
2. **Stage 2**: PCA on reconstruction errors ‚Üí reveals unique characteristics and anomalies

**Why This Works**:
- **Reconstruction errors** contain information that standard PCA cannot capture
- These errors represent the "uniqueness" of each source
- Applying PCA to errors reveals systematic patterns in what makes sources unusual

#### **Key Discovery: The Cross Pattern**

The most remarkable finding is a **distinctive cross-shaped structure** in the reconstruction error PCA space:

- **Central Region**: "Typical" sources well-represented by standard PCA
- **Four Arms**: Distinct modes of deviation from typical behavior
- **High Concentration**: ~90% of "uniqueness variance" captured in just 2 dimensions
- **Systematic Structure**: Clear evidence of four different types of anomalous sources

## üéØ Key Results & Findings

### 1. Data Quality Assessment
- **~65% data retention** after quality filtering (692k ‚Üí 448k sources)
- **Complete spectral information** for all retained sources
- **Robust error measurements** after outlier removal

### 2. Population Structure Discovery
- **Four distinct anomaly patterns** revealed by PCA¬≤ analysis
- **Systematic deviations** from main population trends
- **Potential subpopulations** with unique astrophysical properties

### 3. Anomaly Detection Capability
- **Clear separation** between typical and unusual sources
- **Quantitative outlier scores** based on reconstruction errors
- **Prime candidates** for detailed astrophysical follow-up

## UPDATE: Cross Pattern Investigation

### Overview
After feedback from domain experts I'm worked on a deeper analysis on the complete dataset, not the slim version. Here are the details the investigation into the "cross" pattern that emerged in the anomaly detection analysis of XMM-Newton data, focusing on instrument-specific effects and their impact on anomaly patterns.

### Methodology

#### 1. Full Dataset Analysis
- **Dataset**: Upgraded from slim version to full dataset
- **New Features**: Separate columns for each instrument and combinations:
  - `pn`: PN camera measurements
  - `mos1`: MOS1 camera measurements  
  - `mos2`: MOS2 camera measurements
  - `ep`: Combined instrument measurements
  - `sc`: Combined instruments and observations

#### 2. Minimal Preprocessing
- **Filter Applied**: Only non-optimal observations removed (`sum_flag > 0`)
- **Purpose**: Ensure cross pattern is not an artifact of preprocessing effects
- **Approach**: Minimal intervention to preserve data integrity

#### 3. Feature Selection Strategy
- **Focus**: Flux columns only
- **Exclusions**: Correlated variables (e.g., hardness ratios)
- **Rationale**: Isolate cross pattern from potential feature correlation/engineering effects

#### 4. Instrument-Specific Analysis
Systematic analysis performed on individual instruments:
- **PN-only analysis**: Isolated PN camera data
- **MOS1-only analysis**: Isolated MOS1 camera data  
- **MOS2-only analysis**: Isolated MOS2 camera data
- **Purpose**: Identify potential instrument-mix effects on anomaly patterns

### Key Findings

#### Cross Pattern Persistence
The cross pattern in PCA space **persists only in PN measurements**, indicating preferred directions for anomalies in the principal component space.

#### Instrument-Specific Behavior
- **PN Camera**: Clear cross pattern visible in anomaly detection
- **MOS1 Camera**: Cross pattern absent
- **MOS2 Camera**: Cross pattern absent

### Interpretation

Two potential explanations for the PN-specific cross pattern:

#### Hypothesis A: Instrumental Artifact
The PN measurements themselves create the anomaly patterns due to:
- Inherent characteristics of the PN instrument
- Systematic measurement biases
- Instrument-specific noise patterns

#### Hypothesis B: Detection Sensitivity
The MOS measurements failed to capture this anomaly pattern due to:
- Lower sensitivity to the specific anomaly types
- Different instrumental response characteristics
- Insufficient resolution for pattern detection

#### Hypothesis C: Missmatch observations
The PN dataset does not perfectly overlap with MOS observations (sharing only ~63.1% with MOS1 and ~76.1% with MOS2).
- The non-overlapping observations may introduce unique patterns visible only in PN data
- Differences in observation coverage and exposure can steer the anomaly distribution
- The cross pattern could partly arise from PN-only detections rather than purely instrumental effects

### Implications

The instrument-specific nature of the cross pattern suggests:
1. **Anomaly patterns may be instrument-dependent**
2. **PN camera may be more sensitive to certain anomaly types**
3. **Combined instrument analysis may mask instrument-specific patterns**
4. **Future analysis should consider instrument-specific anomaly detection**
